# LIS161_FINALPROJECT

UP FLIPP is a student organisation based in the School of Library and Information Studies, University of the Philippines Diliman. The aim of this project is to provide a unifying platform where all members can refer to for records in regards to the organisation.

Users are required to register an account using their student number, full name and email. Once done, they are able to log in into the webapp. 

In the webapp itself, there are features that the members are able to use. 

In their dashboard, the members are able to instantly see any announcements posted by the different subcommittess. In the gallery tab, members are able to upload any pictures relevant to the organisation. In the Minutes of the Meeting, the relevant subcommittee can upload the pdf file of the meetings which then can be downloaded by all of the members. Besides that, each member is capable of changing the password of their account. Once all relevant issues have been dealt with, they are able to logout, securing the webapp only for members of UP FLIPP.
